/**
 * The live animation replays that sit on the onboarding pages.

 * Every one of these is a **sibling** of a real component, never a modification of it. The app's
 * production animations are gesture-driven — `ShareMorphButton` morphs off a long-press,
 * `GlassSearchHeader` off a tap — and bolting a "demo mode" parameter onto a shipping component so
 * onboarding can puppet it is how those components rot. Instead each replay re-uses the *same*
 * [GlassMotion] spec and the same easing curves as the thing it is teaching, so the motion is
 * genuinely identical even though the code is separate. The one exception is [DemoToolsMenu], which
 * drives the real [GlassCapsuleMenu] unmodified because that component already exposes a
 * caller-owned `progress`.
 *
 * **Every replay takes `isActive`.** `HorizontalPager` composes the pages either side of the current
 * one, so without gating each loop on visibility all five demos run at once, off-screen, forever.

 * together are what bends the trajectory inward. A constant sweep against a shrinking radius reads
 * as a straight run at the centre; accelerating the sweep is what makes it curve. It also means the
 * paths never cross the same way twice as the stagger shifts them, which is why the motion reads as
 * organic rather than as six objects on rails.
 *
 * **Each sheet runs the same shape on its own delayed clock.** Without the per-index `head` offset
 * all six arrive as one clump; with it the deck assembles a sheet at a time, and `depth` doubles as
 * both the landing order and the fan offset in the settled stack, so the first to arrive ends up
 * furthest back.
 *
 * The fold is `rotationY`, not a `scaleX` squeeze — the near edge has to actually foreshorten or it
 * reads as a card being squashed rather than paper being creased. `cameraDistance` is pulled in
 * tight to exaggerate that at this size.
 *
 * **Only the book is glass.** Six orbiting glass surfaces would mean six blur-and-lens passes per
 * frame; the flying sheets are flat fills moved by `graphicsLayer`, which costs nothing, and the one
 * glass surface arrives at the end, stationary, cross-faded over the top sheet it replaces.

 * watching. Stretching the clock is the only knob that widens the cascade without touching the
 * component, and it costs nothing here because nothing is waiting on this animation.

 * circles, and a constraint narrower than its content silently drops actions rather than shrinking.
