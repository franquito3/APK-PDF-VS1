/**
 * The PDF viewer top bar's glass, as a modifier for surfaces that are not buttons.
 *
 * This is [LiquidIconButton] and [LiquidButton]'s effect stack verbatim — `vibrancy`, a 2 dp blur and
 * a 12x24 lens, with `highlight`/`shadow` left at `drawBackdrop`'s defaults and no inner shadow —
 * lifted off their hardcoded circle and capsule so a panel can wear the same material. Those two
 * components are read-only, hence the copy rather than a shared helper.
 *
 * Deliberately lighter than [liquidGlassPanel], which runs an 8 dp blur, a 20x40 depth lens, a
 * gravity-angled highlight and an inner shadow. That heavier stack is still right for dialogs: they
 * sit over a scrim and need an edge of their own. Chrome sits directly on the document and should read
 * as one material with the buttons floating on top of it.
 *
 * Takes an explicit [color] rather than resolving the theme, so it is not `@Composable` and each
 * viewer passes the same `chromeGlass` its buttons already use.

 * The corner curve [viewerGlass] paints by default.

 * edge. See [carouselEdges].

/**
 * Soft, scroll-aware edge mask for a horizontally scrolling strip that rides on a [viewerGlass]
 * surface.
 *
 * **The bug this exists to kill.** `Modifier.horizontalScroll` clips to its node's *rectangular*
 * bounds, and [viewerGlass] only ever *draws* its rounded shape — `drawBackdrop` paints, it does not
 * clip. A scrolling row of chips on glass was therefore chopped by a straight vertical line sitting
 * inside the capsule's own curve: the one thing a floating glass control must never look like. The
 * mask below is a draw-time fade only — it deliberately does not hard-clip to the glass shape — so
 * controls remain visually above the surface while they are being dragged.
 *
 * Apply it **inside** the glass and **outside** the scroll, with the padding moved to the far end:
 *
 * ```
 * .viewerGlass(backdrop, glass)
 * .carouselEdges(state)
 * .horizontalScroll(state)
 * .padding(horizontal = 12.dp, vertical = 10.dp)
 * ```
 *
 * Two things about that order matter. The glass is drawn by the modifier to the *left*, so it is
 * outside this layer and the capsule keeps its full opacity at the edges — only the chips fade.
 * And padding after the scroll is *content* padding that travels with the content, so the first and
 * last chips rest with the same inset as the gaps between them yet can still reach the true edge
 * mid-scroll. Before the scroll it insets the viewport, which is what put the straight cut 12 dp in
 * from the curve.
 *
 * The fade reads [state] inside the draw lambda, so scrolling invalidates draw only and never
 * recomposes. It is absent at rest on the left, retires as you reach the right end, and is short
 * ([fade] defaults to 18 dp) — a hint that there is more to the side, not a vignette.
